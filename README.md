# Machine Learning Applications in Semiconductor Defect Detection

This project explores machine learning techniques to classify failure types in semiconductor wafer maps. Using the public WM-811K dataset of wafer maps, we explore Naive Bayes and Convolutional Neural Networks as methods for identifying patterns in defective semiconductors.

### Problem Statement
Wafer maps are images that represent semiconductor wafers, and defect detection is crucial for the manufacturing process. This project aims to develop a model that can classify these wafer maps into eight different failure categories (i.e. “Scratch”, “Edge-Ring”, “Edge-Loc”, “Center”, “Random”, “Loc”, “Near-full” and “Donut”) using machine learning.

### Methods
We use several machine learning techniques, including Naive Bayes and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify defective wafer maps. The project includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

### Key Results
Our models successfully classified wafer maps, with a performance of **TO DO**
